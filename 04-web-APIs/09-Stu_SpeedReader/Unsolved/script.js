// # Speed Reader 

// In this activity you are going to create a speed reading application. It will input a single word on the screen at a time, changing to the next word after 1 second. This equates to reading at 60 Words Per Minute (WPM).

// ## Instructions

// * The app should countdown from 5, and when the countdown is finished it should print one word to the screen every second. Each word replaces the other.

// * Open `index.html` and create the necessary HTML. You will need at least 3 elements.

// * Open `script.js`.

//   * The two function names have been created for you, as well as a poem to speed read.

// * Fill out the necessary code that would create a countdown timer. When that timer completes, it should disappear and speed reading should begin.

var poem = "Some say the world will end in ðŸ”¥, Some say in ice. From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate. To say that for destruction ice, Is also great, And would suffice.";

var secondsLeft = 5;

  console.log('test');
}
setTimeout([poem], 5000);




function speedRead() {
  // Print words to the screen one at a time.
}
